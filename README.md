**Autumn 2025 | Brain Science and Artificial Intelligence**

![Course Banner](docs/images/course_banner.jpg)

## Course Description

This course explores the integration of brain science and AI through theory and hands-on practice. Students will learn how AI models help understand the brain and how neuroscience inspires AI algorithm development. Using visual information processing as a foundation, the course covers neural coding, information representation, computational neuroscience, and modern AI architectures including transformers and large language models.

## Course Information

- **Instructor:** Dr. Xiaoxuan Jia

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Master fundamental concepts in computational neuroscience and neural coding
- Apply AI models (CNNs, RNNs, transformers) to analyze brain data
- Build practical skills in neural data analysis and modeling
- Understand how biological intelligence shapes AI development
